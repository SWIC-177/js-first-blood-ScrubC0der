# NodeJS Template Repo

If prompted to install VS Code extensions, do it!

After **cloning** this repo to your computer (remember - don't `clone` into another repo!), don't forget to run: `npm i` and then `cd` into the newly created repo.

Reflection
"This weeks assignment was pretty short and straight to the point. I finally understand how to use git to push changes and make commits to the main. Using Template and Arrows was a bit strange. Template Literals uses backticks instead of quotation marks for string arguments. They also use dollar signs and curly brackets for expressions
 Arrows use the arrow function for "greet" function."
